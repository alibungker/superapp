Your task:
Perform a **complete system documentation and analysis** according to international standards (ISO/IEC and IEEE). The result must include the following four documents, each fully structured and professionally written.

====================================================================
🧩 1. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)
Standard Reference: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018

Include:
- Introduction (Purpose, Scope, Definitions, References)
- Overall Description (System context, users, functions, constraints)
- Functional Requirements (each feature with ID, description, input/output, pre/post conditions)
- Non-Functional Requirements (performance, usability, security, reliability, maintainability, portability)
- External Interface Requirements (UI, API, Hardware, Network)
- Traceability Matrix and Acceptance Criteria

====================================================================
⚙️ 2. SOFTWARE DESIGN DESCRIPTION (SDD)
Standard Reference: IEEE 1016-2009

Include:
- Introduction (Purpose, scope, reference to SRS)
- Architectural Overview (diagrams: C4 model, UML)
- Component Design (modules, logic, data flow)
- Data Design (link to database schema)
- Interface Design (API endpoints, UI components)
- Process Design (flowcharts, sequence diagrams)
- Non-Functional Design (security, scalability, maintainability)
- Implementation Considerations (tech stack, libraries)
- Testing Interface considerations

====================================================================
🗃️ 3. DATABASE DESIGN DOCUMENT (DBDD)
Standard Reference: IEEE 1016 + ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010

Include:
- Introduction and Scope
- Conceptual Data Model (high-level ERD)
- Logical Data Model (detailed ERD with attributes and keys)
- Physical Data Model (actual table schema, index, storage)
- Data Dictionary (table with field name, type, key, nullable, description)
- Data Integrity and Security
- Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
- Backup, migration, and versioning plan

====================================================================
🏗️ 4. DATA ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT (DAD)
Standard Reference: ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 + TOGAF ADM (Phase C)

Include:
- Purpose and Scope
- Enterprise Data Architecture overview
- Data Domains and Sources
- Data Integration Map (between subsystems and external APIs)
- Metadata and Master Data Management
- Data Governance (roles, ownership, policies)
- Security and Compliance (ISO/IEC 27001 controls)
- Data Flow and Lifecycle (collection, transformation, storage, disposal)
- Diagram: Logical and Physical Data Architecture (showing layers: presentation, application, data, integration)

====================================================================
📘 Additional Notes:
- Write in Bahasa Indonesia.
- Output each document with clear section headings (use Markdown format).
- Include all relevant diagrams as text-based placeholders (e.g., `[Insert C4 Diagram Here]`).
- Follow formal ISO/IEEE writing tone, but stay readable.
- Where actual code or data is unavailable, infer and note assumptions clearly.
- Highlight any missing components or recommended improvements for modernization, scalability, and compliance.

Output format:
# 1. Guru_Software_Requirements_Specification_(SRS).md
# 2. Guru_Software_Design_Description_(SDD).md
# 3. Guru_Database_Design_Document_(DBDD).md
# 4. Guru_Data_Architecture_Document(DAD).md

End with a short summary table mapping each ISO/IEEE standard used and its purpose.
